Q1. What are the three measures of central tendency?
The three measures are Mean, Median, and Mode.

Q2. Difference between Mean, Median, and Mode
- Mean: The arithmetic average of all values. Sensitive to outliers.
- Median: The middle value when data is ordered. Resistant to outliers.
- Mode: The most frequently occurring value. Useful for categorical data.

Q3. Measures of central tendency for given height data:
Data: [178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5]
- Mean ≈ 177.3
- Median = 177
- Mode = 177

Q4. Standard deviation for given data:
Data: [178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5]
- Standard Deviation ≈ 1.9

Q5. Measures of dispersion (Range, Variance, Standard Deviation)
- Range: Difference between max and min values. Example: Heights 150–180 → Range = 30.
- Variance: Average squared deviation from mean. Shows spread of data.
- Standard Deviation: Square root of variance. Indicates average distance from mean.

Q6. What is a Venn diagram?
A Venn diagram is a visual representation of sets and their relationships using overlapping circles.

Q7. For sets A = (2,3,4,5,6,7) & B = (0,2,6,8,10):
(i) A ∩ B = {2,6}
(ii) A ∪ B = {0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10}

Q8. What is skewness in data?
Skewness measures the asymmetry of a distribution. Positive skew = tail on right, Negative skew = tail on left.

Q9. Position of median in right-skewed data
In right-skewed data: Mean > Median.

Q10. Difference between covariance and correlation
- Covariance: Measures how two variables vary together. Units dependent.
- Correlation: Standardized measure of relationship (-1 to +1). Unit-free.
Used to analyze relationships between variables.

Q11. Formula for sample mean
Sample mean = (Σx) / n
Example: Data [2,4,6] → Mean = (2+4+6)/3 = 4.

Q12. Relationship between measures of central tendency in normal distribution
In a perfectly normal distribution: Mean = Median = Mode.

Q13. Covariance vs Correlation
- Covariance: Indicates direction of relationship.
- Correlation: Indicates both direction and strength of relationship.

Q14. Effect of outliers on central tendency and dispersion
Outliers can distort mean and increase variance/standard deviation.
Example: Dataset [10,12,11,100] → Mean is inflated, SD is very large.
