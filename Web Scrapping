Q1. What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.
Ans. Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites using programs or scripts.
It allows you to collect information from web pages (like text, links, tables, etc.) and save it in a structured format (like CSV, Excel, or a database).
Web scraping is used to:
Collect real-time data from websites
Automate data gathering from multiple pages
Convert unstructured web content into structured data for analysis 

Common Areas Where Web Scraping is Used:

Area	Example Use Case
ðŸ›’ E-commerce	Scraping prices, product reviews, and availability from Amazon, Flipkart, etc.
ðŸ“° News & Media	Collecting headlines or articles from news sites like BBC, NDTV, etc.
ðŸ“Š Job Portals / Listings	Extracting job postings, company names, and requirements from websites like Naukri or LinkedIn

Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?
Ans There are several methods and tools used for web scraping, depending on the complexity of the task and the structure of the website 
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = 'http://quotes.toscrape.com'
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

quotes = soup.find_all('span', class_='text')
for quote in quotes:
    print(quote.text)

Method	Description
1. Using Python Libraries	Use tools like BeautifulSoup, Requests, lxml, Scrapy
2. Browser Automation Tools	Use tools like Selenium or Playwright to scrape data from dynamic (JavaScript-based) sites
3. APIs (Preferred)	When websites provide public APIs, you can get structured data directly
4. Headless Browsers	Use headless Chrome or Firefox to load and scrape content programmatically
5. Online Scraping Tools	Tools like Octoparse, ParseHub, or WebHarvy (no coding needed)

Q3. What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?
Ans. BeautifulSoup is a Python library used for parsing HTML and XML documents.
It creates a parse tree from the page source code, allowing you to easily navigate and extract data from web pages.
It works very well with libraries like requests, which handle downloading the page content.

Reason	Description
âœ… HTML Parsing	Parses messy or poorly formatted HTML (like real-world websites)
âœ… Tag Navigation	Allows easy navigation using tags, classes, and attributes
âœ… Data Extraction	Helps extract specific text, links, images, etc. from web pages
âœ… Integration	Works smoothly with libraries like requests, lxml, and urllib
âœ… Lightweight & Easy	Easy to learn and implement for beginners
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

# Step 1: Send a request to the website
url = "http://quotes.toscrape.com"
response = requests.get(url)

# Step 2: Parse the HTML
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

# Step 3: Extract all quotes
quotes = soup.find_all('span', class_='text')

# Step 4: Print them
for quote in quotes:
    print(quote.text)


Q4. Why is flask used in this W Scraping project?
Ans.- Flask is a micro web framework for Python, and it can be very useful in a web scraping project for several reasons. Flask allows you to easily create web applications and APIs that can interact with your web scraping scripts and present scraped data in a structured and user-friendly way.
 Serve Scraped Data	Flask can be used to serve the scraped data to users in a web interface or API endpoint.
âœ… Create Interactive Interfaces	Flask allows you to build simple web interfaces, so users can interact with the scraper (e.g., input parameters for scraping).
âœ… Scheduled Scraping	You can integrate Flask with tools like Celery or APScheduler to schedule periodic scraping tasks.
âœ… Real-time Data Access	With Flask, you can show live updates of scraped data on a web page by calling scraping functions.
âœ… Return JSON or HTML	Flask can return scraped data in JSON for API responses or HTML for displaying on a webpage.
âœ… Build APIs for External Use	If you need others to interact with your scraping system, Flask allows you to expose your data through a REST API.
from flask import Flask, render_template
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    # Web scraping part: Fetch and scrape data
    url = 'http://quotes.toscrape.com'
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    quotes = [quote.text for quote in soup.find_all('span', class_='text')]
    
    # Return the scraped data on a web page
    return render_template('home.html', quotes=quotes)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Q5. Write the names of AWS services used in this project. Also, explain the use of each service.
Ans.For a web scraping project hosted on AWS (Amazon Web Services), the following AWS services are typically used. Here's an explanation of each service and its role:
 EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)	Hosts the Python code or Flask application that performs web scraping tasks. EC2 provides a scalable and customizable virtual server to run your scraping scripts and web app.
2. S3 (Simple Storage Service)	Stores the scraped data (e.g., CSV, JSON, or text files) for easy retrieval and access. S3 offers secure, scalable, and cost-effective storage.
3. Lambda	Runs serverless scraping tasks in response to events (like API requests, scheduled events, etc.) without needing to manage servers. Useful for lightweight scraping or triggered jobs.
4. CloudWatch	Monitors and logs scraping tasks. It helps you keep track of logs, errors, and performance metrics, which can help you troubleshoot and optimize your scraping scripts.
5. API Gateway	Creates and manages APIs to expose the scraped data to users or other systems. API Gateway can provide a secure way to access your scraping data as an API.
6. RDS (Relational Database Service)	Stores structured scraped data in a database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. You can organize and query scraped information easily.
7. IAM (Identity and Access Management)	Manages permissions and access controls to ensure that only authorized users or services can access the scraping data or EC2 instances.
8. CloudFront	Distributes content (e.g., scraped data or static files) globally with low latency and fast access using a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
9. SQS (Simple Queue Service)	Manages and queues scraping tasks or requests in distributed scraping systems. You can queue jobs to be processed later, helping with scalability and load balancing.
10. Step Functions	Coordinates multiple AWS services (like Lambda, EC2, and SQS) to automate and orchestrate more complex scraping workflows.

Explanation of Each Service:
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):

EC2 instances act as the servers that run your web scraping scripts and Flask web applications.

You can choose different instance types based on the scraping complexity (CPU, memory, storage).

S3 (Simple Storage Service):

S3 is an object storage service that is used to store large amounts of data.

For example, after scraping product details or prices from an e-commerce site, you can save the data in a CSV file and store it in an S3 bucket.

Lambda:

AWS Lambda allows you to run Python scripts without the need to manage any infrastructure. You only pay for the time your code is running.

Itâ€™s ideal for event-driven scraping, where scraping tasks can be triggered by API calls or scheduled jobs.

CloudWatch:

CloudWatch helps monitor logs and metrics from your scraping processes and web apps.

You can create alarms to notify you of any issues, like scraping failures or server performance degradation.

API Gateway:

If you want to expose your scraped data via an API, you can use API Gateway.

It can be configured to send scraped data to users or other applications that can consume it in a structured format (like JSON).

RDS (Relational Database Service):

RDS is a fully managed relational database that can store structured scraped data.

You can store information in databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL and query it efficiently for further analysis.

IAM (Identity and Access Management):

IAM ensures that only authorized personnel or services can access your EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and other resources in the project.

It allows you to define permissions and roles for different users or applications.

CloudFront:

If you're serving static content (like images or text files) along with scraped data, CloudFront can distribute that content globally with low latency.

SQS (Simple Queue Service):

SQS is a message queuing service that helps with distributed scraping tasks.

If you're scraping many pages at once, you can use SQS to queue scraping jobs and process them asynchronously to handle large workloads efficiently.

Step Functions:

AWS Step Functions allow you to orchestrate multiple services in a workflow. You can combine EC2, Lambda, and SQS to manage complex scraping pipelines (e.g., queueing tasks, performing scraping on multiple websites, and storing results).

ðŸ§  Summary Table:

AWS Service	Purpose/Use
EC2	Hosts scraping scripts and web applications.
S3	Stores scraped data (files, images, etc.).
Lambda	Runs serverless scraping tasks on demand.
CloudWatch	Monitors logs and metrics of scraping tasks and web apps.
API Gateway	Creates APIs to expose scraped data for external use.
RDS	Stores structured scraped data in a relational database.
IAM	Manages access control for AWS resources.
CloudFront	Distributes static content (scraped data) globally with low latency.
SQS	Queues and manages asynchronous scraping tasks.
Step Functions	Orchestrates multiple AWS services to automate scraping workflows.
