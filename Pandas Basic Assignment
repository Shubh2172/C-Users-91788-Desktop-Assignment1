Q1. Create a Pandas Series that contains the following data: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42. Then, print the series.

import pandas as pd
series1 = pd.Series([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42])
print(series1)


Q2. Create a variable of list type containing 10 elements in it, and apply pandas.Series function on the variable. Print it.

my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
series2 = pd.Series(my_list)
print(series2)


Q3. Create a Pandas DataFrame that contains the following data:

import pandas as pd
data = {
    "Name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Claire"],
    "Age": [25, 30, 27],
    "Gender": ["Female", "Male", "Female"]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)


Q4. What is 'DataFrame' in pandas and how is it different from pandas.Series? Explain with an example.

A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure in Pandas, similar to a table with rows and columns.  
A Series is a 1-dimensional labeled array that can hold data of any type.  
Example:
series = pd.Series([1,2,3])
dataframe = pd.DataFrame({"Numbers":[1,2,3], "Squares":[1,4,9]})


Q5. What are some common functions you can use to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame? Can you give an example?

Common functions: head(), tail(), describe(), info(), drop(), groupby(), sort_values(), fillna(), merge().  
Example: df.describe() gives summary statistics of numerical columns.


Q6. Which of the following is mutable in nature Series, DataFrame, Panel?

Answer: All three (Series, DataFrame, Panel) are mutable in nature.


Q7. Create a DataFrame using multiple Series. Explain with an example.

s1 = pd.Series([1,2,3], name="Column1")
s2 = pd.Series([4,5,6], name="Column2")
df2 = pd.DataFrame({s1.name: s1, s2.name: s2})
print(df2)
