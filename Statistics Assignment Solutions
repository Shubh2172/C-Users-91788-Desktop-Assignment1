Q1. What is Statistics?
Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data to make informed decisions. It helps summarize large amounts of information and draw meaningful conclusions.

Q2. Types of Statistics
- Descriptive Statistics: Summarizes and describes data using measures like mean, median, mode, variance, and graphs.
  Example: Calculating the average marks of a class.
- Inferential Statistics: Uses sample data to make predictions or generalizations about a population.
  Example: Predicting election results based on a survey of voters.

Q3. Types of Data
- Qualitative (Categorical) Data: Non-numeric, describes categories.
  Example: Colors of cars (red, blue, black).
- Quantitative (Numerical) Data: Numeric, measurable values.
  - Discrete: Countable values (e.g., number of students in a class).
  - Continuous: Measurable values within a range (e.g., height, weight).

Q4. Categorization of Datasets
(i) Grading in exam (A+, A, B+, …) → Qualitative (Ordinal)
(ii) Colour of mangoes (yellow, green, …) → Qualitative (Nominal)
(iii) Height data of a class → Quantitative (Continuous)
(iv) Number of mangoes exported → Quantitative (Discrete)

Q5. Levels of Measurement
- Nominal: Categories without order (e.g., blood type).
- Ordinal: Ordered categories (e.g., exam grades).
- Interval: Numeric scale without true zero (e.g., temperature in °C).
- Ratio: Numeric scale with true zero (e.g., weight, income).

Q6. Importance of Levels of Measurement
Understanding levels ensures correct statistical methods are applied.
Example: You can’t calculate a mean for nominal data like colors, but you can for ratio data like income.

Q7. Nominal vs Ordinal Data
- Nominal: Categories with no order (e.g., gender, nationality).
- Ordinal: Categories with a meaningful order (e.g., rankings, grades).

Q8. Plot for Range Display
A Box Plot (Whisker Plot) is commonly used to display data in terms of range, showing minimum, maximum, median, and quartiles.

Q9. Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics
- Descriptive: Summarizes data (e.g., average age of employees).
- Inferential: Makes predictions/generalizations (e.g., predicting employee satisfaction across the company from a sample survey).

Q10. Measures of Central Tendency & Variability
- Central Tendency:
  - Mean → Average value.
  - Median → Middle value.
  - Mode → Most frequent value.
- Variability:
  - Range → Difference between max and min.
  - Variance → Spread of data around mean.
  - Standard Deviation → Average distance from mean.

These measures describe both the "center" and "spread" of a dataset.
