Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.
Ans. - API stands for Application Programming Interface.
An API is a set of rules and definitions that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It acts like a messenger that takes a request from one system, gets data or service from another, and returns the result.
 Simple Explanation:
Imagine a restaurant.

You (the user) sit at a table with a menu (interface).
The waiter (API) takes your order and goes to the kitchen (server).
The kitchen prepares the food (data), and the waiter brings it back to you.

Real-Life Example of API:
📱 Example: Weather App
When you open a weather app or website, it shows you current weather data.

That app doesn’t collect weather itself — it uses a Weather API like:

Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.
Ans. -->
Advantage	Explanation
🔁 Easy Integration	APIs allow different systems to talk to each other, even if built in different languages.
🚀 Faster Development	Reuse existing APIs instead of building features from scratch.
📦 Access to Services/Data	Get data from services like Google Maps, weather, or payment gateways.
🔒 Security	APIs can restrict access and provide data safely via tokens or keys.
⚙️ Automation	Tasks can be automated (e.g., fetching stock prices or weather data daily).
📱 Cross-platform Compatibility	Same API can be used in web apps, mobile apps, etc.
Disadvantage	Explanation
🛠️ Dependency on Third-party	If the API provider changes or stops the service, your app may break.
🌐 Network Required	Most APIs need internet to fetch data, which can be a problem offline.
⚠️ Security Risks	If not secured properly, APIs can be exploited or misused.
📉 Performance Issues	Relying on external APIs can slow down your app if the API response is delayed.
🔐 Rate Limiting	Many APIs limit how many requests you can send per minute/hour/day.

Q3. What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.
Ans. -A Web API is a type of API that allows interaction between different software applications over the internet (using HTTP/HTTPS).

It is usually used to allow a client (browser or app) to interact with a server to request or send data.
GET https://api.github.com/users/saurabh
Feature	API	Web API
🌐 Access	Can be local or web-based	Always accessed over the web (HTTP/HTTPS)
🔧 Communication	Any method (library calls, OS calls, etc.)	HTTP/HTTPS requests only
📦 Data Format	Not fixed (can be binary, XML, etc.)	Usually JSON or XML
🧱 Example	OS API, Database API	REST API, GraphQL API, Weather API
🛠️ Usage	Broader use (internal app components)

Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.
Ans - 🔷 REST (Representational State Transfer)
REST is an architectural style used to design lightweight and scalable Web APIs. It uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to access resources identified by URLs.

✅ Key Features of REST:
Stateless (each request is independent)

Uses standard HTTP methods
Data is usually exchanged in JSON or XML
Client-server architecture

SOAP is a protocol for accessing web services. It uses XML messages and operates over various protocols (HTTP, SMTP, etc.).

✅ Key Features of SOAP:
Based on XML

Follows a strict messaging structure (SOAP envelope, header, body)
Supports WS-Security, transactions, and ACID compliance
Designed for enterprise-level applications

Although SOAP is powerful and secure, especially for enterprise applications, it has several limitations that make it less suitable for modern web and mobile environments:

🔻 1. Complex and Verbose
SOAP messages are written in XML, which is bulky and harder to read compared to JSON.

Requires wrapping data in envelopes, headers, and body tags, increasing complexity.

🔻 2. Slower Performance
XML parsing and the overhead of strict formatting make SOAP slower than REST-based services, especially over low-bandwidth networks.

🔻 3. Harder to Implement and Maintain
Requires understanding of WSDL (Web Services Description Language).

Building and consuming SOAP services is more difficult and time-consuming than REST APIs.

🔻 4. Less Flexible
Only supports XML data format.

Limited support for different content types like JSON, which is widely used in modern apps.

🔻 5. Not Browser-Friendly
Difficult to consume SOAP services directly from JavaScript in the browser (due to CORS, security headers, etc.).

REST is more natural for browser-based and mobile apps.

🔻 6. Tight Coupling
SOAP services are often tightly coupled with the client due to rigid contracts, making them harder to change and evolve over time.

🔻 7. Limited Caching Support
SOAP doesn’t leverage HTTP caching mechanisms as easily as REST, which can affect performance in read-heavy applications.

Q5. Differentiate between REST and SOAP.
Ans - Here’s a clear comparison between REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) based on various key points:


🔹 Feature	🔸 REST	🔸 SOAP
Type	Architectural style	Protocol
Data Format	Supports JSON, XML, HTML, etc.	Supports only XML
Protocol	Uses HTTP only	Uses HTTP, SMTP, TCP, etc.
Speed & Performance	Faster (lightweight, less bandwidth)	Slower due to heavy XML messages
Ease of Use	Simple and easy to integrate	Complex, requires WSDL and strict format
Message Format	No strict format, just HTTP methods	Uses strict envelope structure in XML
Caching Support	HTTP caching supported	Not well-supported
Security	Basic (OAuth, HTTPS, tokens)	High (WS-Security, SSL, etc.)
Flexibility	Flexible, loosely coupled	Rigid, tightly coupled
Use Cases	Web, mobile apps, public APIs	Enterprise apps, banking, payment systems
Error Handling	Simple HTTP status codes	Complex error handling structure
