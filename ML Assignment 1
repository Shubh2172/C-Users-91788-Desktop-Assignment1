Q1: Explain the following with an example:
1) Artificial IntelligencE
2) Machine LearninH
3) Deep Learning
Ans).Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI is the broad field of making machines capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, decision-making, or understanding language.
Example: A chatbot that answers customer queries in natural language is an AI system.

Machine Learning (ML): ML is a subset of AI where machines learn patterns from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed.
Example: An email spam filter is ML. It learns from thousands of emails labeled “spam” or “not spam” and then predicts whether a new email should be blocked.

Deep Learning (DL): DL is a specialized branch of ML that uses artificial neural networks with many layers (hence “deep”) to process complex data like images, audio, or text.
Example: Facial recognition on smartphones is DL. The system uses deep neural networks to analyze facial features and match them to stored data, unlocking the phone only for the right person.

Relationship:
AI is the big umbrella.
ML is one way to achieve AI.
DL is a powerful technique within ML, especially for complex tasks like vision, speech, and natural language.

Q2: What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.
Ans). Supervised Learning:Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained using labeled data. In this approach, the input data (features) are paired with the correct output (labels),
and the algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs. Once trained, the model can predict outcomes for new, unseen data.

Examples of Supervised Learning:
1. Email Spam Detection – Classifying emails as "spam" or "not spam."
2. Sentiment Analysis – Determining whether a product review is positive or negative.
3. Fraud Detection – Identifying fraudulent transactions in banking systems.
4. Medical Diagnosis – Predicting whether a patient has a disease based on medical test results.
5. Credit Scoring – Assessing whether a loan applicant is likely to repay based on historical data.
6. Image Classification – Recognizing objects in images, such as cats vs. dogs.

Q3:  What is unsupervised learning? List some examples of unsupervised learning.
Ans). Unsupervised Learning:Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained using data that is not labeled. Unlike supervised learning, there are no predefined outputs or categories.
The algorithm tries to find hidden patterns, structures, or relationships within the data on its own.

Examples of Unsupervised Learning:
1. Customer Segmentation – Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior without prior labels.
2. Market Basket Analysis – Finding associations between products often bought together.
3. Anomaly Detection – Identifying unusual patterns such as fraudulent transactions or network intrusions.
4. Document Clustering – Organizing news articles or research papers into topics automatically.
5. Image Compression – Reducing image size by identifying patterns in pixel data.
6. Recommendation Systems – Suggesting products or movies based on user behavior similarities.

Q4: What is the difference between AI, ML, DL, and DS?
Ans). Difference between AI, ML, DL, and DS:

Artificial Intelligence (AI):
AI is the broad field of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as reasoning, problem-solving, and understanding language.
Example: Virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa.

Machine Learning (ML):
ML is a subset of AI where machines learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on building models that can make predictions or decisions based on input data.
Example: Email spam filters that learn to classify emails as spam or not spam.

Deep Learning (DL):
DL is a specialized branch of ML that uses artificial neural networks with many layers (deep networks) to process complex data such as images, audio, and text. It is especially powerful for tasks involving large datasets and high-dimensional data.
Example: Facial recognition systems in smartphones.

Data Science (DS):
DS is the interdisciplinary field that combines statistics, programming, and domain knowledge to extract insights and knowledge from data. It often uses AI and ML techniques but also involves data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling.
Example: Analyzing customer purchase data to identify trends and improve business strategy.

Summary of Relationship:
- AI is the broad umbrella of intelligent systems.
- ML is a subset of AI focused on learning from data.
- DL is a subset of ML that uses deep neural networks.
- DS is the broader practice of working with data to generate insights, often using AI/ML/DL as tools.

Q5: What are the main differences between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning?
Ans). Differences between Supervised, Unsupervised, and Semi-Supervised Learning:

Supervised Learning:
- Uses labeled data (input-output pairs).
- The model learns to map inputs to known outputs.
- Goal is to predict outcomes for new data.
Example: Email spam detection (emails labeled as "spam" or "not spam").

Unsupervised Learning:
- Uses unlabeled data (only inputs, no outputs).
- The model tries to find hidden patterns or groupings in the data.
- Goal is to discover structure within the data.
Example: Customer segmentation (grouping customers by purchasing behavior without labels).

Semi-Supervised Learning:
- Uses a mix of labeled and unlabeled data.
- A small portion of data is labeled, and the model leverages the larger unlabeled set to improve learning.
- Goal is to achieve better accuracy when labeling all data is expensive or impractical.
Example: Medical image classification where only a few scans are labeled by experts, but many unlabeled scans are available.

Summary:
- Supervised learning = labeled data, prediction-focused.
- Unsupervised learning = unlabeled data, pattern-discovery.
- Semi-supervised learning = combination of both, useful when labels are limited.

Q6: What is train, test and validation split? Explain the importance of each term.
Ans.)Train, Test, and Validation Split:

Train Set:
- The training set is the portion of data used to teach the machine learning model.
- The model learns patterns, relationships, and weights from this data.
Importance: It is the foundation of the model’s knowledge. A good training set ensures the model can generalize well.

Validation Set:
- The validation set is a separate portion of data used during training to tune hyperparameters and evaluate performance.
- It helps in preventing overfitting by checking how well the model performs on unseen data while still in the training phase.
Importance: It guides model selection, parameter tuning, and ensures the model is not just memorizing the training data.

Test Set:
- The test set is the final portion of data used to evaluate the model after training is complete.
- It is completely unseen by the model during training and validation.
Importance: It provides an unbiased estimate of the model’s real-world performance and generalization ability.

Summary:
- Train set = used to learn.
- Validation set = used to tune and validate.
- Test set = used to evaluate final performance.

Q7: How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?
Ans). Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection because it does not require labeled data. Instead, it identifies patterns, clusters, or structures in the data and highlights data points that do not fit 
these patterns. These "outliers" are considered anomalies.

How it works:
- The algorithm groups similar data points together (clustering).
- Data points that fall far outside these clusters are flagged as anomalies.
- It can also detect unusual patterns in data distribution without prior labels.

Examples:
1. Fraud Detection – Identifying unusual credit card transactions that differ from normal spending behavior.
2. Network Security – Detecting abnormal traffic patterns that may indicate cyberattacks.
3. Manufacturing – Spotting defective products by finding items that differ from the majority.
4. Healthcare – Identifying abnormal patient health records that may signal rare diseases.
5. Sensor Data – Detecting unusual readings in IoT devices or industrial machines.

Importance:Unsupervised learning is valuable in anomaly detection because anomalies are rare and often not labeled in advance. It helps organizations detect unexpected issues, risks, or fraud without needing
predefined examples.

Q8: List down some commonly used supervised learning algorithms and unsupervised learning algorithms.
Ans). Commonly Used Supervised Learning Algorithms:
1. Linear Regression – Predicts continuous values (e.g., house prices).
2. Logistic Regression – Used for classification problems (e.g., spam detection).
3. Decision Trees – Splits data into branches to make predictions.
4. Random Forest – Ensemble of decision trees for better accuracy.
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM) – Finds the best boundary between classes.
6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – Classifies based on closest data points.
